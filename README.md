# Gmail-Email-Categorizer
The Gmail Email Categorizer is a Chrome extension that automatically scans and classifies emails in your Gmail inbox into smart categories like:

It enhances your email experience by color-coding subject lines, allowing manual scans by category, and even exporting spam emails to a downloadable .csv file.
